	 Camomile Tea
  -by Katherine Mansfield
    <br>
    <br>
      Outside the sky
    <br>

      is light with stars;
    <br>
      Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
  <br>
      And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
    <br>
      The wind is shaking the almond tree.
    <br>
  <br>


      How little I thought, a year ago,
    <br>
      In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
  <br>
      That he and I should be sitting so
    <br>
      And sipping a cup of
    <br>
      camomile tea.
    <br>
  <br>


      Light
    <br>
    as feathers the witches fly,
    <br>
      The horn of the moon is plain to see;
  <br>
      By a firefly under a jonquil flower
    <br>
      A goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
  <br>
  <br>



      We
  <br>
      might be fifty,
    <br>
      we
    <br>
      might be five,
    <br>
      So snug,
    <br>
      so compact,
    <br>
      so wise are we!
  <br>
      Under the kitchen-table leg
    <br>
      My knee
  <br>
      is pressing
  <br>
    against his knee.
  <br>
  <br>


      Our shutters
    <br>
      are shut,the fire is low,
  <br>
        The tap is dripping peacefully;
    <br>
      The saucepan shadows on the wall
  <br>
    Are black and round and plain to see.
