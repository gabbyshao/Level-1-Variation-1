      <h2>Camomile Tea</h2>
      <h4>-by Katherine Mansfield</h4>

      <br>
      <br>
        Outside the sky
      <br>
        is light with stars;
      <br>
        Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
      <br>
        And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
      <br>
        The wind is shaking the almond tree.
      <br>

        How little I thought, a year ago,
      <br>
        In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
      <br>
        That he and I should be sitting so
      <br>
        And sipping a cup of
      <br>
        camomile tea.
      <br>
      <br>

<div class="box-row1">
        Light
      <br>
      as feathers the witches fly,
      <br>
        The horn of the moon is plain to see;
      <br>
        By a firefly under a jonquil flower
      <br>
        A goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
      <br>
      <br>
        We
      <br>
        might be fifty,
      <br>
        we
      <br>
        might be five,
      <br>
        So snug,
      <br>
        so compact,
      <br>
        so wise are we!
      <br>
        Under the kitchen-table leg
      <br>
        My knee
      <br>
        is pressing
      <br>
      against his knee.
      <br>
      <br>


        Our shutters
      <br>
        are shut,the fire is low,
      <br>
          The tap is dripping peacefully;
      <br>
        The saucepan shadows on the wall
      <br>
      Are black and round and plain to see.
