		<h2>Camomile Tea</h2>
		<h4>-by Katherine Mansfield</h4>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Outside the sky is light with

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href=”flowers”>stars</a>;
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				There’s a hollow roaring from
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				the sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				And, alas! for the little almond
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”stars”>flowers</a>,
			</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				The wind is shaking the almond
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				tree.
			</P>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHow little I thought, a year ago,
			</p>
			<p>
				In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat he and I should be sitting so
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbspAnd sipping a cup of camomile tea.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Light as feathers the witches
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				fly,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe horn of the moon is plain to
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”a bumble-bee”>see</a>;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy a firefly under
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				a jonquil flower
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A goblin toasts
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”see”>a bumble-bee</a>.
			</P>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe might be fifty, we might be five,
			</p>
			<p>
				So snug, so compact, so wise are we!
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnder the kitchen-table leg
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspMy knee is pressing against his knee.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur shutters are shut, the fire is
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”peacefully”>low</a>,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				The tap is dripping
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”wall”>peacefully</a>;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe saucepan shadows on the
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”see”>wall</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAre black and round and plain to
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				<a href=”low”>see</a>.
			</p>
