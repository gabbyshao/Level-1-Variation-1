	<h2>Camomile Tea</h2>
	<h4>-by Katherine Mansfield</h4>

	<br>
	<br>
		Outside the sky
	<br>

		is light with stars;
	<br>
		Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
	<br>
		And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
	<br>
		The wind is shaking the almond tree.
	<br>
	<br>


		How little I thought, a year ago,
	<br>
		In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
	<br>
		That he and I should be sitting so
	<br>
		And sipping a cup of
	<br>
		camomile tea.
	<br>
	<br>


		Light
	<br>
	as feathers the witches fly,
	<br>
		The horn of the moon is plain to see;
	<br>
		By a firefly under a jonquil flower
	<br>
		A goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
	<br>
	<br>
		We
	<br>
		might be fifty,
	<br>
		we
	<br>
		might be five,
	<br>
		So snug,
	<br>
		so compact,
	<br>
		so wise are we!
	<br>
		Under the kitchen-table leg
	<br>
		My knee
	<br>
		is pressing
	<br>
	against his knee.
	<br>
	<br>


		Our shutters
	<br>
		are shut,the fire is low,
	<br>
			The tap is dripping peacefully;
	<br>
		The saucepan shadows on the wall
	<br>
	Are black and round and plain to see.
