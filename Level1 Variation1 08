				<h2>Outside the sky is light with stars;</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspThe wind is shaking the almond tree.
			</P>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<h3>How little I thought, a year ago,</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat he and I should be sitting so
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbspAnd sipping a cup of camomile tea.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLight as feathers the witches fly,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp<h4>The horn of the moon is plain to see;</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<h4>By a firefly under a jonquil flower</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
			</P>
		<br>
			<p>
				<div id="Section 2">
				<h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe might be fifty, we might be five,</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				So snug, so compact, so wise are we!
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnder the kitchen-table leg
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp
				<h3>My knee is pressing against his knee.</h3>
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur shutters are shut, the fire is low,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tap is dripping peacefully;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe saucepan shadows on the wall
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Are black and round and plain to see.</h2>
			</p>
