		<h2>Camomile Tea</h2>
		<h4>-by Katherine Mansfield</h4>

			<p>
				Outside the
			</p>
			<p>
				sky is light with stars;
			</p>
			<p>
				Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
				The wind is shaking the almond tree.
			</P>
		<br>


			<p>
				How little I thought, a year ago,
				In the horrible cottage upon the Lee
			</p>
			<p>
				That he and I should be sitting so
			</p>
			<p>
				And sipping a cup of
			</p>
			<p>
				camomile tea.
			</p>
		<br>

			<p>
				Light
			</p>
			<p>
			as feathers the witches fly,
			</p>
			<p>
				The horn of the moon is plain to see;
			</p>
			<p>
				By a firefly under a jonquil flower
				A goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
			</P>
		<br>


			<p>
				We
				might be fifty,
				we
				might be five,
				So snug,
				so compact,
			</p>

			<p>
				so wise are we!
				Under the kitchen-table leg
			</p>

			<p>
				My knee
				is pressing
			</p>
			<p>
			against his knee.
			</p>
		<br>

			<p>
				Our shutters
			</p>
			<p>
				are shut,the fire is low,
			</p>
			<p>
					The tap is dripping peacefully;
			</p>
			<p>
				The saucepan shadows on the wall
			Are black and round and plain to see.
			</p>
