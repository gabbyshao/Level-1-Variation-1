    <h1>Camomile Tea</h1>

		<h2>by Katherine Mansfield </h2>

        Outside the sky is light with stars;

      <br>

        Thereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.

    <br>
        And, alas! for the little almond flowers,

      <br>
        The wind is shaking the almond tree.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

        How little I thought, a year ago,

      <br>
        In the horrible cottage upon the Lee

      <br>
        That he and I should be sitting so
      <br>
      And sipping a cup of camomile tea.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        Light as feathers the witches fly,

      <br>
        The horn of the moon is plain to see;

      <br>
        By a firefly under a jonquil flower

      <br>
        A goblin toasts a bumble-bee.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

        We might be fifty, we might be five,

        <br>


        So snug, so compact, so wise are we!
    <br>
        Under the kitchen-table leg
    <br>
        My knee is pressing against his knee.
    <br>
      <br>
      <br>

          Our shutters are shut, the fire is low,
    <br>
        The tap is dripping peacefully;

    <br>
        The saucepan shadows on the wall

      <br>
        Are black and round and plain to see.
